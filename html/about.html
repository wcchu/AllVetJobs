        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>
                Our team is founded by two experienced veterinarians- Dr. A. Tarassov and Dr. F. Chang. Dr. Tarassov has
                finished two internships (Emergency and Critical Care, and Neurology), and worked as medical director at
                a 24-hour hospital before becoming a successful independent clinic owner and medical director of two GP
                practices. Dr. Chang worked as an ER veterinarian in a specialty clinic in AZ before moving to Germany
                in 2014 due to family; now she occasionally travels back to the US to work ER relief shifts when she is
                needed. They did their Emergency and Critical Care internship together in 2009 and have kept their
                friendship throughout the years.</p>
            <p> We have personal experience being on both sides of the interviewing process and understand the hard work
                going into finding a suitable fit. It is often time-consuming and frustrating for both the employers and
                the candidates to try and find the right match; even with the help of regular recruitment agencies the
                process might not be simplified by much and the results are often not ideal. With our wide database,
                personal connections and good understanding of the industry, we are able to find the best match for both
                parties and spare you the tedious process of repeatedly searching and interviewing.
